sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: because bubble sort take least time when the file is sorted.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: merge sort takes least time when the file is unsorted.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: usally the time taken is same in both sorted and unsorted.

// my rough work:
time taken:unsorted
sort1:6.017
sort2:0.756(merge sort)
sort3:4.466
time taken:sorted
sort1:0.697(bubble sort)
sort2:0.743
sort3:4.437(selection sort)
